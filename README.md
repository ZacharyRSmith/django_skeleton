# django_skeleton
A skeleton Django project for future Django projects. This has set up:

Django-Registration-Redux for auth

Some bootstrap

A home, about, and index page

Has sqlite3 database with admin username "admin" pw "password"

This has three sanity tests that will probably break after website content is changed.

SET UP:

Rename two skeleton dirs to your project's name

Rename all occurences of "skeleton" in your files to your project's name

RECOMMENDED CHANGES:

Add title base to base.html
