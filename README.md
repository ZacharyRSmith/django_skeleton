# django_skeleton
A skeleton Django project for future Django projects. This has set up:

Django-Registration-Redux for auth
Some bootstrap
A home, about, and index page

This has three sanity tests that will probably break after website content is
changed.

SET UP:
Rename two skeleton dirs to your project's name
Rename all occurences of "skeleton" in your files to your project's name
Set up database
Set up database superuser (python manage.py createsuperuser)

RECOMMENDED CHANGES:
Add title base to base.html
